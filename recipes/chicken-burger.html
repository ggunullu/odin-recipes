    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A chicken burger the whole family enjoys!
        Natasha is my eldest daughter, and her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner.
        The onion can be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it.
        I usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very comforting meal!
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound extra-lean ground chicken</li>
        <li>½ cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
        <li>½ small onion, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>

        <li>
            Mix ground chicken, 1/4 cup bread crumbs, onion, egg, and garlic in a bowl.
            Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Moisten hands and shape chicken mixture, 2 tablespoons at a time, into flat, oval-shaped patties.</li>
        <li>
            Spread remaining 1/4 cup bread crumbs in a shallow dish.
            Dip patties in bread crumbs to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>
            Cook patties in hot oil until deeply browned on the bottoms, 5 to 6 minutes.
            Turn patties and cook until other sides are browned, 3 to 4 minutes more.
        </li>
